										<h1>Rancang Karier</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/rancangkarier.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Rancang Karier is a platform to answer the high unemployment rate challenges and the lack of career knowledge in Indonesia by supplying a media that can provide planning, preparation, and career development for youth. </p>
									<p>Indonesia has the 4th highest population in the world, with a productive age proportion of 70% in 2020-2030. So, Indonesia would have a demographic bonus in that period. But, If Indonesia canâ€™t maximize that potential number, it would be a disaster.</p>
									<p>The unemployment rate in Indonesia in August 2020, was 10 million people. And the job vacancy is not directly proportional to the job seeker. In 2020, Badan Pusat Statistik said, DKI Jakarta has the highest job seeker number with 938.269 people, followed by Jawa Barat 715.395 people, Jawa Tengah 449.506 people, Jawa Timur 432,256 people, and Riau with 273.394 people. Sadly, the number above is dominated by the youth in age 15-29 (productive age). </p>
									<p>There are several factors related to the high unemployment rate in Indonesia, there are imbalance number of the available job and the job seeker, technology advances, the lack skill of the job seeker, the low quantity of education, the poverty rate, work terminations (especially in COVID-19), far from their hometown (wander), global market, the difficulties to match the available job with the job seeker, and the high expectation from the job seeker. 
									<p>There are a few factors related to the lack of career knowledge in Indonesia, the low quantity of education, the poverty rate, far from their hometown (wander), the difficulties to match the available job with the job seeker, the lack skill of job seeker, and the high expectation from the job seeker. So, we need a place where we can plan, prepare, and develop the career for the youth, in inclusive ways, with no discrimination
									<p>Plenty of media for career planning, provided by the state (BKK), or by the youth themselves. But the main problem is uneven information spreading. From the state itself, there is a platform to provide skill preparation for unemployed youth, called Kartu Prakerja. Because of the complicated system, many of the youth are unable to participate, so this program can't run evenly. Beside that, there are many youth that participate just because they want incentive from the program. From the youth itself, there is actually a lot of innovation about career planning, for example Aksel,Glints, Mau.kerja etc. But with relatively high cost, it can't be reached by local youth.
									<p>There are a lot of platforms that talk about career planning and self improvement, but many of those are exclusive and haven't reached students' pockets but only higher class. Rancang Karier came to erase that stigma, as an inclusive platform, Rancang Karier provides local youth a chance to improve themselves and broaden their knowledge about careers in the 4.0 technology era. Because of that, Rancang Karier will build a relationship with local organizations in every Universities (state or private) in Indonesia. So within growing global competition, these local youth will have the abilities to become an Agent of Change, confident, and able to improve themselves to reach their wanted career.
									<ol>
									<li>With that idea, I want myself to focus and think of the best design to do the intervention.</li> 
									<li>Needs social media technology to start market and product research to fulfill target needs. Rancang Karier was  created for youth, so social media is a main platform to do some marketing strategy activities, such as using Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Tiktok to have connections and collaborate with local organizations established at all universities in Indonesia. Beside, Indonesia is a nation with an archipelago geographic, </li>
									<li>Rancang Karier needs a website as a main information platform to go through all places. For further events, Rancang Karier will be held by Zoom or Google Meet, with hope that all targets can have maximum service. With all collaboration with these technologies, Rancang Karier hopes it will ease all service users.</li>
									<li>Rancang Karir will held few roadshow both virtually and directly, to introduce our brand and our goal to all of students/jobseeker in Indonesia.</li>
									<li>Rancang Karir will provide all of the planning, preparation, and career development product with reasonable price and ease of access in Indonesia with web-based and software based to support the user across country.</li>
